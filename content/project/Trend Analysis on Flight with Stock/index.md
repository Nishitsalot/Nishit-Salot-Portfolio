While looking at seasonality overall, the Spring season had the highest frequency of flights over the last three years. We inferred that this was because Spring has temperate weather and because there is Spring break around this time. We also inferred, after looking closer at the data, that this was likely due to Covid-19 restrictions in 2020 which made Summer travel harder to do than it used to be in 2018 and 2019. Our initial hypothesis was confirmed when looking at the spread of delays by season, as Winter took the lead. However, it was not for the reason we expected, as weather made up a very small percentage of the total delays. Consistently, thoughout all the seasons, late aircraft delay accounted for the most significant percentage of delays which is most likely due to its all-encompassing nature for all late aircraft.

Similarly, from both the location and airport end, late aircraft delay accounted for the majority of airline delays. While we know that late aircrafts are the major cause of delays within our dataset, it is hard to truly interpret the actionable solutions, as the culpability of late aircrafts can lie within other delays that preceeded the one labelled "late aircraft delay". Furthermore, aside from "late aircraft delay" and "security delay", the spread of delays amongst each carrier and location is fairly varied, so even by looking at the second most frequent delay for each category, the solutions vary. However, when analyzing each respective location and carrier alone, we can better determine the factors affecting each category and seek improvements.

From the additional analysis done on the average delay of carriers, it was determined that SkyWest had the most reliability in terms of least average delays over the years 2018-2020, followed by Southwest, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, and finally United Airlines.

In terms of trends over time, there was a clear impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on flight delays. Outside of the number of cancelled flights increasing at this time due to health concerns, the number of delays also grew significantly. We attributed this increase to growing safety measures as a result of the pandemic taking more time to perform.

From the previous conclusions, the evidence for the butterfly effect resulting from one flight delay to the next became more and more prevalent, leading to a more thorough investigation into the relationship between arrival and departure delays. By investigating which flights' early, on-time, and late departure times affected flights' early, on-time, and late arrival times, there was a clear correlation that accounted for 78% percent of all flights which signified that flights that left late, arrived late. The correlations between early and delayed and on-time and delayed were much weaker, with on-time still having a higher percentage of delays than early departures by 7%.

The effect of flight delays on stocks was not significant until the beginning of the knowledge of Covid-19, due the daily flight delays not being excessively long on average. However, we can conclude that in the covid era, which began on January 1, 2020, trading is being done on the sentiment of flight delays.

Through our report, we were able to analyze the trend and spread of delays through time, by carrier, and by location. In it we were able to document how Covid-19 affected many of the normal happenings of flights and even reoriented the investor sentiment to caring about flight delays per carrier. While many of us are disgruntled at the airline carriers themselves when our flights get delayed, this analysis displays that, transportation is often subject to unforeseen circumstances despite individual best practices of players within the industry to ensure the safety of its passengers. This analysis sets the groundwork for further research and analysis into the main causes of late aircraft delays for each aircraft for each carrier. The findings from this project can be further used to determine the sensitivity of other transportation services from 2018-2020 and the sensitivity of their stocks to the delays caused by the pandemic.
